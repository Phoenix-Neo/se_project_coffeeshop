# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would have loved to add an animation in the header image, something moving inside the coffee shop to bring it more to life, like a book falling from the shelf or having the baristas multiple arms move. Adding a more vibrant font to the menu items.
